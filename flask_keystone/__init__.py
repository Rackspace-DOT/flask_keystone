"""
Flask Extension to allow Flasky user and role handling for Keystone.

This Extension wraps :keystonemiddleware: to provide authentication and
role access via the OpenStack Keystone project, by parsing the headers
returned from :class`keystomemiddleware.auth_token` and creating a User
object to be attached to the request.

This user object is governed with the concept of "configured roles" which
are roles specific to this application that map to lists of upstream
Keystone roles.

Configured roles are established in the :mod:`oslo.config` configuration
file, and can then be accessed in code within your application.

Once the User object is created and attached to the request object,
it works much in the same way as Flask-Login. The user itself is exposed
via :obj:`flask_keystone.current_user`, and several helper
function and decorators exist (most useful of which are
:func:`FlaskKeystone.requires_role` and :func:`User.has_role`).
